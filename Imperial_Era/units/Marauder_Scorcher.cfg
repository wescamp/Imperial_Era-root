unit_description= _ "Some of the most powerful and experienced Marauders choose not to take on the responsibilities of being a Marauder Lord, and instead choose to be the first to land and plunge into battle. They wield a torch in battle, and, as a symbol of their status in Marauder society, are always given the right to burn away the first civilized building during raids. Their strength and fury in battle is a constant source of tales throughtout the land, and even the most skilled warriors can not stand in their way for long."
