unit_description= _ "Among the finest scouts known, wild elf trackers are swift and versatile, skilled in both hand to hand and ranged combat when using short spears.

Special notes: Their primary spear they coat with the sap of a certain shrub, giving it a poisonout tinge, but they would consider it cowardly to do this for their javelins as well."
