"Any Arendian clan only supports and upkeeps the best archers out of war "
"time. Training neww archers is never a priority. This means that any archers "
"who do join the clan's army in times of need are usually hunters from the "
"clans or towns, those already familiar with their weapons. They have little "
"to no armour, and whatever bow they use at their homes, typically a handmade "
"hunting bow, or a family heirloom. They are also normally expected to hunt "
"for their own food, and supply their own arrows. \n"
" But in the end all of this is worth it, for any archers who do get accepted "
"as regulars are treated well with good pay and food."

"souvent des chasseurs des clans ou des villes sachant déjà se servir de "
"leurs armes. Ils n'ont pas ou peu d'armure, et uniquement l'arc qu'ils "
"emploient chez eux, généralement un arc de chasse fait main, ou un héritage "
"familial. Ils sont normalement sensés chasser pour assurer leur subsistance, "
"et doivent se procurer eux-mêmes leurs flèches. Mais au final, ces "
"contraintes valent la peine, car tout archer accepté dans l'armée sera bien "
"traité, nourri et payé."

"Arrow winds are the best archers in all of Arendia, able to notch and fire "

"challenged to prove his prowess by firing arrows repeatedly in an outline "
"around his his wife, and yet not kill her. When asked about this later she "
"likened it to a gentle breeze. Because of this the most skilled archers are "
"known as arrow winds. Nowadays the appelation has come to refer to the sound "
"of their arrows. Capable of putting three arrows in the air before the first "
"has hit the target, the sound of so many arrows in flight is likened to a "
"rushing wind of death over the battlefield."
