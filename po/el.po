"who do join the clan's army in times of need are usually hunters from the "
"clans or towns, those already familiar with their weapons. They have little "
"to no armour, and whatever bow they use at their homes, typically a handmade "
"hunting bow, or a family heirloom. They are also normally expected to hunt "
"for their own food, and supply their own arrows. \n"
" But in the end all of this is worth it, for any archers who do get accepted "
"as regulars are treated well with good pay and food."

"Arrow winds are the best archers in all of Arendia, able to notch and fire "

"around his his wife, and yet not kill her. When asked about this later she "
"likened it to a gentle breeze. Because of this the most skilled archers are "
"known as arrow winds. Nowadays the appelation has come to refer to the sound "
